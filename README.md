# IPTA 2025 Student Week Lecture
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/davecwright3/ipta-2025/master)

This repository contains a lecture on Bayesian inference that I gave at the International Pulsar Timing Array student week in 2025. Dependencies are preferably managed with `uv`, but a `requirements.txt` is also included for `pip` and `Binder` setup. There are no `conda-forge` dependencies.

You may install the extra dependencies in the `[jupyter-extensions]` optional dependency group to enable a Dracula color scheme, LSP utilities, Vim keys, and more.
